## **Welcome All**

Welcome to my Homepage! Here you will learn a little bit about me, my family, my education, and my career goals.

### Field of Study

I am majoring in Computer Science and will finally be graduating at the the end of the Fall 2022 semester. My college path did not begin at CSUCI, but I am so glad that I ended up here because I absolutely love the university.
