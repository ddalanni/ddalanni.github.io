### [Where I Grew Up]{.underline}

I have two children who I love very much: Johnathan and Violet. Johnathan is now 14, and Violet is 2, but I absolutely love these pics!

I was raised in Santa Barbara, California. I love my hometown, and am thankful for the lessons and memories I have from being there. Growing up surrounded by such natural and architectural beauty was truly a blessing.

These two children are absolutely the reason why I work as hard as I do. Currently, I work full time, am a full time student, and will be participating in research this semester. I hope to one day give them a better future, and more stable environment.
